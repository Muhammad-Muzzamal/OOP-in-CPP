###########################what is constructor?#####################

constructor is a special type of member function which is automatically called when the object is created.

1)A constructor is a member function that has the same name as the class.
2)It is automatically called when the object is created in memory, or instantiated.
3)They are very useful for initializing member variables or performing other setup operations. 
4)Syntax:
    class Demo
    {
    public:
     Demo(); // Constructor
    };
    Demo::Demo()
    {
     cout << "Welcome to the constructor!\n";
    }
5)There is no return type not even void. 
6)Classes with No Default Constructor:
When all of a class s constructors require arguments, then the class does not have a default
constructor. In such a case you must pass the required arguments to the constructor when
creating an object. Otherwise, a compiler error will result.

###################constructor overloading#############################3


A class can have more than one constructor.
A class s member functions may be overloaded, including the constructor. One constructor
might take an integer argument, for example, while another constructor takes a double.
There could even be a third constructor taking two integers. As long as each constructor
takes a different list of parameters, the compiler can tell them apart. For example, the
string class has several overloaded constructors. The following statement creates a
string object with no arguments passed to the constructor:
