Class:
    "Class is the primarliy constructed to create an onbject"
1) a class is similar to the structure
2) it is the user defined data type
3) it contains member functions and member variales

class Rectangle
{
    double length;
    double width;
};
dont forget to put the semicolon at the end of the class 

4) the members of the class are private by default.So no member can access outside the class 
5) we use public access specifier to give access member to access outsie the class.
