there are two type of programming is practice today:
    Procedural programming
    Object-Oriented-Programming


--> what is procedural programming?

2) it is a programming practice that focused on the the procedures or actions in the programming.
3) Data is stored in the collection of variables, structures and coupled with the set of functions that perform operation on it.

5) Function Defination:

    setdata();
    diaplaylength();
    displaywidth();
    displayarea();



--> what is Object-Oriented-Programming(OOP)?

1) OOP is is centered around the objects.
2) the objects are created abstract data-type that encapsulate and function together.
3) Encapsulation refers to the combining of data and code into a single object.
4) Data hiding refers to an object s ability to hide its data from code that is outside the object.
5) Object: Object is basically as a "BLue print" of the object may be created from.it serves as a blue-print of a a house.blue-print is not itself a house .it contains the details description about the house.
